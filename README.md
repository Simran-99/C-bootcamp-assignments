Assignment 15.
1. Write a function to find the greatest number from the given array of any size. (TSRS)
2. Write a function to find the smallest number from the given array of any size. (TSRS)
3. Write a function to sort an array of any size. (TSRS)
4. Write a function to rotate an array by n position in d direction. The d is an indicative
value for left or right. (For example, if array of size 5 is [32, 29, 40, 12, 70]; n is 2 and
d is left, then the resulting array after left rotation 2 times is [40, 12, 70, 32, 29] )
