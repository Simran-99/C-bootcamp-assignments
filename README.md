Assignment 15.
1. Write a function to find the greatest number from the given array of any size. (TSRS)
2. Write a function to find the smallest number from the given array of any size. (TSRS)
3. Write a function to sort an array of any size. (TSRS)
4. Write a function to rotate an array by n position in d direction. The d is an indicative
value for left or right. (For example, if array of size 5 is [32, 29, 40, 12, 70]; n is 2 and
d is left, then the resulting array after left rotation 2 times is [40, 12, 70, 32, 29] )
5. Write a function to find the first occurrence of adjacent duplicate values in the array.
Function has to return the value of the element.
6. Write a function in C to read n number of values in an array and display it in reverse
order.
7. Write a function in C to count a total number of duplicate elements in an array.
8. Write a function in C to print all unique elements in an array.
9. Write a function in C to merge two arrays of the same size sorted in descending
order.
10. Write a function in C to count the frequency of each element of an array.

2. Write a program to calculate the product of two matrices each of order 3x3.
3. Write a program in C to find the transpose of a given matrix.
4. Write a program in C to find the sum of right diagonals of a matrix.
5. Write a program in C to find the sum of left diagonals of a matrix.
6. Write a program in C to find the sum of rows and columns of a Matrix.
7. Write a program in C to print or display the lower triangular of a given matrix.
8. Write a program in C to print or display an upper triangular matrix.
9. Write a program in C to accept a matrix and determine whether it is a sparse matrix.
10. Write a program in C to find the row with maximum number of 1s.
